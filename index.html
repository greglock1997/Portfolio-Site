                        <p class="skills-paragraph">I use vanilla CSS in almost every one of my projects for styling webpages, with very
                           minimal experience using Bootstrap and Bulma. Through a lot of practice I've developed a good understanding of the basic concepts
                           like the box-model, selectors, specificity and so on. I've used both grid and flexbox
                           to design my pages but feel much more confident in my abilities with flexbox. Recently I've
                           been working on adding responsive design to my projects and even dabbling in CSS animations.

                        <h3>JavaScript &#9660;</h3>
                        <p class="skills-paragraph">Throughout my journey learning web development JavaScript is definitely the skill
                            I've spent the most time working on and what I'd consider my greatest strength as a developer. Over the past
                            few years I've used JavaScript to for a variety of purposes including DOM manipulation, data entry and retrieval
                            from backend servers, API use, adding ineractivity, animation and so on.
                            <br></br>
                            In future I'd like to get better at using JavaScript for some of the concepts I struggle with a little such as
                            asynchronous programming and error handling. As well as a delving into some frameworks like TypeScript.

                        <h3>Node JS &#9660;</h3>
                        <p class="skills-paragraph">I've always wanted to be able to make complex, multi-page and useful
                            websites like most you would find on the internet instead of simple single-page applications so
                            learning how to make how to create a server environment was essential. I decided to learn Node JS
                            along with Express JS for it's familiar syntax.
                            <br></br>
                            So far I've mainly used Node/Express for simple routing tasks but also simple login systems as well as
                            authorisation such as giving 'Admin' or 'Member' users access to extra pages that normal users would not.
                            Furthermore I often use Node/Express to save or read data from databases like MongoDB.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Mongoose / Mongo DB &#9660;</h3>
                        <p class="skills-paragraph">For creating CRUD applications MongoDB has always been my
                            database of choice for its flexible schemas and easy to follow syntax. For now I've only
                            used Mongoose for simple data manipulation like storing usernames and encrypted passwords
                            using packages like bcrypt. On occasion using two sets of simple data like login details and 
                            user scores in a game, but nothing complex. I'm hoping to learn more about relational databases in future.

                        <h3>Git / Github &#9660;</h3>
                        <p class="skills-paragraph">Being self taught I've never worked in a team as a web developer and thus
                            only started learning how to use Git / Github very recently, but have found it very useful to keep
                            track of my work and reduce errors while editing or updating projects.
                            <br></br>
                            So far I've gotten a solid grasp on pulling and pushing data to a git repository as well as creating
                            new branches but I'm still working on mastering version control.

                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>
                            A full stack application that allows users to login to their own account
                            learn Japanese characters and then practice them in a quiz-like game. Upon
                            opening the application the user will be asked to login before learning, if the
                            user lacks an account by registering using simply a username and password, no email
                            address required. After logging in with a new account the user will be shown
                            various flashcards of Japanese characters inlcuding their pronunciation and their
                            english translation. After learning a few new characters the user will be presented
                            with a short quiz to test their knowledge.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Each user has their scores tracked for each vocabulary item and saved to a
                            database so that in future they will be quizzed on each character based on their
                            current level of knowledge, a basic version of a spaced-repition-system. Additionally,
                            if the user logs in as an admin (username: Admin, password: Password), they will get
                            access to the edit and create pages. These extra pages allow the user to add new
                            vocabulary items to the database as well as delete or edit existing items.
